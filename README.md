# langchain-rag-youtube-transcripts
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project using LangChain to process YouTube video transcripts. The pipeline extracts transcripts, splits text into chunks, generates embeddings, and stores them in a FAISS Vector Store for indexed similarity search. Includes retriever-based question answering with OpenAI LLM integration.
